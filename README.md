**Apply genetic algorithms to solve real-world AI and machine learning problems**

## What is this book about?

This book will help you gain expertise in genetic algorithms, how they work, and when and how to use them to create Python-based apps. By the end of this book, you’ll have hands-on experience in applying genetic algorithms to AI and other domains.

This book covers the following exciting features:

- Use genetic algorithms to solve planning, scheduling, gaming, and analytics problems
- Create reinforcement learning, NLP, and explainable AI applications
- Enhance the performance of ML models and optimize deep learning architecture
- Deploy genetic algorithms using client-server architectures, enhancing scalability and computational efficiency
- Explore how images can be reconstructed using a set of semi-transparent shapes
- Delve into topics like elitism, niching, and multiplicity in genetic solutions to enhance optimization strategies and solution diversity

## Instructions and Navigations

All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:

```
def busy_wait(duration):
    current_time = time.time()
    while (time.time() < current_time + duration):
        pass
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you’re a data scientist, software developer, AI enthusiast who wants to break into the world of genetic algorithms and apply them to real-world, intelligent applications as quickly as possible, this book is for you.
